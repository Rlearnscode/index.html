      <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I will be showing you how to make this simple but delicious meal in 20 minutes. </p>

        <ul> Ingredients
          <li> 2 slices bacon </li>
          <li> 4 teaspoons butter, divided </li>
          <li> 3 large eggs </li>
          <li> 1 pinch freshly ground black pepper </li>
          <li> 1 pinch salt </li>
          <li> 1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese </li>
          <li> 4 slices bread </li>
        </ul>

    <h2> Directions </h2>
    <ol> <p><strong> STEPS TO FOLLOW </strong></p>

        <li>
        <p><strong>Place</strong>  bacon in a nonstick skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning, </p>
        <p> until evenly browned, about 7 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. </p>
        <p>Remove bacon to a drip line tray. Drain off bacon grease for another use.</p>
        <p>Wash out the skillet.</p></li>

        <li>
        <p> Whisk eggs with salt and pepper in a small bowl until frothy.</p></li>

        <li>
        <P> Melt 2 teaspoons butter in the nonstick skillet over medium heat.</P>
        <p>Pour in beaten eggs; let cook for 30 seconds.</p>
        <p>Lift the edges of the omelet so that the uncooked egg runs under the cooked edges</p>
        <p> and comes into contact with the hot skillet.</P> 
        <p> Shake and tilt the skillet to move the uncooked egg. Repeat until the top is set,</P>
        <p> about 3 minutes; reduce heat to low.</P></li>

        <li>
        <p> Meanwhile, chop bacon roughly; sprinkle over omelet. Sprinkle with cheese;</p> 
        <p> allow cheese to melt, 1 to 2 minutes.</p></li>

        <li>
        <p> Meanwhile, butter 2 slices of bread with 1/2 teaspoon butter each. Lay bread,</p>
        <p> buttered side up, side-by-side over omelet, leaving about 1 inch between slices.</p>
        <p>The melted cheese will help the bread adhere.</p></li>

        <li>
        <p> Run a spatula around the entire omelet to loosen from the skillet.</p>
        <p> Carefully turn the omelet over so buttered side of bread is in contact with the skillet.</p>
        <P> Cook until bread is toasted and golden, about 2 minutes.</p></li>

        <li>
        <p> Using the spatula, fold in edges of omelet to align with sides of the bread. Cut omelet along </p> 
        <p> the center with the spatula to form 2 sandwiches. Butter 2 remaining bread slices with remaining butter;</p>
        <p> place butter side up on each sandwich. Turn sandwiches; cook until golden, about 2 minutes more.</p>
        <p> Serve and enjoy immediately!</p></li>
